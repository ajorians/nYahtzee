nYahtzee

About:
This is another game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-nSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1.  At this time I don't know about whether it will work on other models.  It is played much like the popular dice game.

How to put on Calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nSimon.tns file onto your calculator.  First if you don't have it; install ndless 3.1!

How to play:
Use either Enter or Ctrl buttons to start the game
Roll by having the red selector over "Roll" and hitting Enter or Ctrl
The green numbers lets you know the value you'd get if you chose to score on that category
You can do up to a total of 3 rolls before needing to chose the category for a score
To hold dice so they don't get rolled again hover over them with the red selector and hit Ctrl or Enter.  Held dice move down.  You can change your mind and unhold dice too.
It might be advantage to take a zero in a score category; but you get to decide how you'd like to play!
The game ends when all 13 score categories are filled up.  You can choose to play again.

Get the highest score you can!  And have fun!

Source:
I included my source.  I programmed with C++ which you can find out more here: http://blog.tangrs.id.au/?p=712  It uses nRGBlib as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.

Minor Yahtzee notes:
A Yahtzee cannot be a Full House (3 of a number and 2 of another).
With bonus Yahtzees you get a 100 point bonus and can enter a score in any of the score categories.
